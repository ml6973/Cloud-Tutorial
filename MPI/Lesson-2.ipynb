Then we have the receiving process print the value of the vairable into which we will receive to show that it is zero, and then we print the value that it receives after the call to *Recv*. *Send* and *Recv* are referred to as blocking functions. That is, if a process calls *Recv*, it will sit idle until it has received a message from a corresponding Send before it will proceeed. See the appendix for the corresponding non-blocking functions *Isend* and *Irecv* (I stands for immediate). In essence, Irecv will return immediately."

See the appendix for the corresponding non-blocking functions *Isend* and *Irecv* (I stands for immediate). In essence, *Irecv* will return immediately. If it did not receive its message it will indicate to the system that it will be receiving a message, proceed beyond the *Irecv* to do other useful work, and then check back later to see if the message has arrived. This can be used to dramatically improve performance. On a *Recv* you do not always need to specify the source. Instead, you can allow the calling process to accept a message from any process that happend to be sending to the receiving process. This is done by setting source to a predefined MPI constant, *source=ANY_SOURCE* (note that you would first need to import this with from *mpi4py.MPI import ANY_SOURCE* or use the syntax *source=MPI.ANY_SOURCE*)."
